This is the summary to start the LLM learning
1. Basic AI Concepts.ipynb is to highlight and clarify some concepts  related to AI for learners
2. Milvus vector database.ipynb is to summarize the core concepts and operations for Milvus
3. Notebooks under LLM_Foundationse_VectorDB_4_Cache_and_RAG are practical applications of LLM operations using Milvus. I learned from this course [LLM Foundations: Vector Databases for Caching and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/llm-foundations-vector-databases-for-caching-and-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/genai-with-vector-databases)  But I was working in a Windows environment, and some of the packages used in the courses are deprecated, these issues have been listed fixed in the notebooks.
4. There are three notebook responses for Vector DB basic operations including creating index and similarity search, using Vector DB as an LLM cache, and an RAG application separately
